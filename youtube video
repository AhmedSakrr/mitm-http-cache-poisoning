Thanks to etherDream for implementing the source code for this demo. https://github.com/EtherDream/mitm-ht...

Two corrections:
1. The poison only works for urls specified in url.txt
2. You don't need to open a website for sniffing to work. It will load automatically for urls from the url.txt
Thanks for watching.
